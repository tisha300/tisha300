I am a passionate and self-motivated learner currently focusing on Web Design and Front-End Development. I have a solid foundation in HTML,CSS,JavaScript and version control using Git & Github. I'm continuously expanding my skill to become a full-fledged web developer by learning new technologies and frameworks.

Besides web development,I also have basic knowledge of Graphic Design and Microsoft Office tools,which helps me approach projects with both creativity and structure, I enjoy building clean,responsive,and user-friendly websites that provide real value to users.

My goal is to start a successful freelancing career while being opet to ICT-related job opportunities where I can grow and contribute. I believe in consistent learning,problem-solving and creating meaningful digital experiences.
